## GG: Game Giveaways

Most gaming clients nowadays offer free games very often (Specially EPIC) and I've always found it hard to check all the stores out every week. I wanted an app that would notify me when a game goes free. After a lot searching around, I decided to make my own. Through this app, you can see all available free games and active giveaways and get notified when a game goes free.

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun tauri dev
```
